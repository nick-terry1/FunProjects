### Project CatFoodCalc

This program will calculate the amount of food that you should feed your cat based on the National Research Council's 2006 report titled "Nutrient 
Requirements for Cats and Dogs". Report can be found [here](https://www.merckvetmanual.com/management-and-nutrition/nutrition-small-animals/nutritional-requirements-and-related-diseases-of-small-animals#v3326268) 
The average calorie content for a cup of cat food and a 6 oz. can of cat food was found [here](https://dunlogginvet.com/how-many-calories-should-your-dog-or-cat-eat-daily/)
