### Project CatFoodCalc

This program will calculate the amount of food that you should feed your cat based on the National Research Council's 2006 report titled "Nutrient 
Requirements for Cats and Dogs". That report can be found [here](https://www.merckvetmanual.com/management-and-nutrition/nutrition-small-animals/nutritional-requirements-and-related-diseases-of-small-animals#v3326268).
The average calorie content for a cup of cat food and a 6 oz. can of cat food was found [here](https://dunlogginvet.com/how-many-calories-should-your-dog-or-cat-eat-daily/).
  
### Project ConvertToBinary  

This program was originally a challenge on the website [HackerRank.com](https://www.hackerrank.com/challenges/30-binary-numbers/problem) 
but I had a lot of fun making it and it can be useful to some extent so I figured I'd put it up here. Nothing was stolen from HackerRank the 
entire program was built from scratch, the idea for it simply came from them.  

### Project StringCompress  

This program takes a user input string and compresses it to a form that deletes all repeated sequential characters and inserts a number in its place. If the string can't be compressed it returns the original string. The algorithm has a complexity of O(n).
  
### Project BasilBodyTemp

This is for women who are trying to get pregnant by predicting when they are ovulating. The program does this by allowing the user to input their Basil Body
Temperature (BBT) once a day and finding trends in those values and outputting whether youre ovulating or the last date you were ovulating. It also lets the user 
delete data in case they want to start over or just accidentally input the wrong temperature. All data is inserted into a database and saved 
using LINQ and SQL Server. The information on reading trends in BBT came from two websites, 
[WikiHow.com](https://www.wikihow.com/Take-Your-Basal-Body-Temperature) and [FertilityPlus.com](http://www.fertilityplus.com/faq/bbt/bbtfaq.html). Credit Beth Terry for the program idea.
