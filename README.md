### Project CatFoodCalc

This program will calculate the amount of food that you should feed your cat based on the National Research Council's 2006 report titled "Nutrient 
Requirements for Cats and Dogs". That report can be found [here](https://www.merckvetmanual.com/management-and-nutrition/nutrition-small-animals/nutritional-requirements-and-related-diseases-of-small-animals#v3326268).
The average calorie content for a cup of cat food and a 6 oz. can of cat food was found [here](https://dunlogginvet.com/how-many-calories-should-your-dog-or-cat-eat-daily/).
  
### Project ConvertToBinary  

This program was originally a challenge on the website [HackerRank.com](https://www.hackerrank.com/challenges/30-binary-numbers/problem) 
but I had a lot of fun making it and it can be useful to some extent so I figured I'd put it up here. Nothing was stolen from HackerRank the 
entire program was built from scratch, the idea for it simply came from them.
